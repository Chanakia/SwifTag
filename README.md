# Auto Tagging System 
Insight Data Engineering Fellowship Program Project.
This project provide real-time auto tagging suggestions for users that post questions on StackOverflow according to the question title.

### Business Value: 
  High quality data is essential in data mining and product analytics work, for questions related data, if "tag" information could be appended appropriately. Data scientists can perform user identification & behavior pattern recognization better. 
  
  However, not all the users can choose tags appropriately for their questions due to several reasons: 1) questions could be complicated and cover several areas that users don't know how to choose appropirate tags   2) sometimes users are just forget or lazy to attach tags.
  
  With auto-tagging service in this project, we can provide real-time __top 3 tags__ recommendation after typing in question title. We also provide end users options to delete or add tags based on their preference. In this way, data scientists can get better quality question data and use it perform clustering, user behavior investigation and recommendation model evaluation better.
